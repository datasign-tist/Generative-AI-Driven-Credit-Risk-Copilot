## Step 01: Problem Understanding & Business Requirements :

### A. Define Forecasting Targets:
Identify the key financial metrics to forecast—primarily Revenue, Default Rates, and Asset Values—which are critical for business planning, risk assessment, and investor reporting.

### B. Understand Business Impact:
Clarify the accuracy expectations (how close the forecasts need to be to actuals), forecast horizon (e.g., monthly, quarterly, yearly predictions), and latency tolerance (how fast the forecasts need to be generated and updated). This ensures the model meets real-world decision-making needs.

### C. Identify Stakeholders:
Engage with cross-functional teams, including Risk Management (to assess credit risk and defaults), Finance (for budgeting and revenue planning), and Technology Teams (for deployment and automation). Understanding their objectives and constraints is key to building a relevant and usable solution.

All 3 steps are crucially important as these are like Google Maps, and without them, your project will be directionless.
